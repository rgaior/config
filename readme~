readme about what is needed / what needs to be changed to configure the simulation
author: Romain Gaior

The simulation are based on the CROME code, which was based from the Kascade code I guess.
There are some parts of the code we don't really need. 
My usage of the simulation code will be to focus on the radio signal, 
but I want to separate the electronics simulation or the data analysis from this code.
I want this code to give only a trace of power versus time (or flux).
The two executable I will use are: 
   - mwSimulation_1 to produce the actual simulation
   - dumpsimfile to extract the waveform and event into text files


I tried to clean my version in the config file as well.
  - ArrayModels: ArrayModels.xml : only 1 file with all the types of arrays 
  (this is not where the detectors to be included are defined, this is just to define the size of the array)

  - MicrowaveDetector: this define the detector to be included in the simulation
  We need here 4 files:
     - EASIER61
     - GIGADuck-L     
     - GIGADuck-C
     - Gorham
  The other files are in the /test/ folder

  - ChannelModels: sensor characteristics: BW/ Tsys / nr of bins / center frequency
  1 file with all the channel type: ChannelModels.xml    

  - GainPatterns: folder with the gain patterns
    - EASIER
    - AInfo
    - Helix
  The other files are in the /test/ folder

  - GHShowerSimulation: Energy / angle / core position 
    - Random with correct spectrum
    - Gorham style
    - Real event
  The other files are in the /test/ folder

  - TraceSimulator: contains LDF type / thinning / MBR characteristics
  juste one file:TraceSimulator.xml


#############################
#### the config files #######
#############################
The config file contains the path of the configuration files mentioned above.
It gathers the information needed to produce a simulation.
here we need:
     - Config for real data: 
       	      	  - MicrowaveDetector:EASIER61/GIGADuck-C/GIGADuck-L
		  - GHShowerSimulation:Real event

     - Config for sensitivity: 
       	      	  - MicrowaveDetector:EASIER61/GIGADuck-C/GIGADuck-L
		  - GHShowerSimulation:random in 1 hexagon

     - Config for Gorham check: 
       	      	  - MicrowaveDetector:Gorham (no antenna)
		  - GHShowerSimulation: Gorham
